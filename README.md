# Project Proposal - BudgetBro

### What and why?

Sometimes, tracking our cash flow can be difficult. It's hard to remember how much we've spent this month, or how much we're making next month. We have trouble visualising where our money goes and comes from. That's where a budgeting tracker comes into play. I'd like to build a web app that is a comprehensive expense and income tracker, complete with a login system, and an interface that's easy to understand and simple to use.

This software will primarily be for anyone who needs to track their spendings, from students to families and to the mass market. Students like me are usually on a limited budget, so I believe that an app like this can help them plan their spendings and savings more efficiently. Families that share a budget can also benefit from this application's login system, as the same account can be accessed from multiple devices.

### For whom?

This system will include all the necessary functionalities of a basic expense and income tracker, such as logging cash flows along with the name, category, and date. With each log, the user will also be able to include optional icons, pictures, notes and descriptions. The user will also be able to create recurring expenses or incomes that will automatically log itself at any specific interval. 

### How?

When the user opens the app, they will be greeted with a homepage that shows a summary of the current month's cash flow, including but not limited to graphs and doughnut charts. However, the user can also navigate to a tab where they are shown specific tables of their cash flow. Users can select categories, dates, or even unique names they want to be shown on the table, filtering out other unselected items.

BudgetBro will also include a register and login system so users can separate accounts on one device, or share an account on multiple devices.

### Scope

Finally, This project can be tackled with medium difficulty by 4-6 programmers. This project will consist of multiple different components that can be delegated to each individual group member. For example, one can work on database implementation, another can work on timezone implementation, and another can work on user interface design.
